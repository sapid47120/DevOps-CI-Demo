🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Node.js (v18 or v20 recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js)

Git

Installation
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ci-pipeline-project
npm install

Running the App
const { sum, subtract, multiply } = require('./mathOps');

console.log(sum(2, 3));        // 5
console.log(subtract(5, 3));   // 2
console.log(multiply(2, 4));   // 8

Running Tests
npm test
npm run test:watch
npm run test:coverage

⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

Triggers: On push & pull requests to main

Test Job: Runs Jest on Node v18 & v20

Lint Job: Checks code quality

Build Job: Ensures successful build after tests

Push to GitHub
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main


Then check the Actions tab on GitHub for workflow status.

Would you like me to also rename the project folder and package.json "name" to match this README (e.g., ci-pipeline-project) so it looks clean and non-copy? 🛠
